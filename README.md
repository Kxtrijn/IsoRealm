# IsoRealm (placeholder)

A small isometric singleplayer RPG prototype in Python.

- Run: install requirements then run `python src/main.py`

- Controls:
  - Arrow keys: move on the isometric grid
  - Space: attack adjacent monster
  - E: gather resource on current tile

- Replace images in `assets/tiles/` and `assets/sprites/` with your tileset/sprites (keep names: `grass.png`, `water.png`, `stone.png`, `sand.png`, `player.png`, `monster.png`, `resource.png`).

Notes:
- On first run placeholder images are autogenerated; drop your PNGs into the `assets` folders to replace visuals.
- The code is intentionally compact and in `src/main.py` so you can read and modify movement, combat, and rendering logic easily.
